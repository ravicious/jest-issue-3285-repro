[Issue 3285](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/3285).

```
cd packages/bar && yarn install && cd ../foo && yarn install && yarn run linklocal && yarn run jest
```

The package foo imports the linked package bar which imports react-text-mask
(I chose this lib because this is one that's causing problems for me).
foo has its babel config, but when you run jest, it'll crash with the following error:

```
